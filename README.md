# :newspaper: Project Description
<p align="justify ">
This work was carried out in the Computer Networks discipline and aimed to familiarize students with programming network applications using sockets, formalizing a protocol for this. 
In short, we needed to build an application similar to Whatsapp following the protocol specification created by professor Dr. Pedro de Botelho Marcos presented in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HDQIMFCnF1UYwMGFSK9v0luRymGnoUypVbuNAI-cCPQ/edit">link</a>.

## Architechture

Interzap's architecture is designed to support real-time communication between clients and servers using sockets. Below is an overview of the main components and how they interact:

```
interzap/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ server/                  # Directory containing the server code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ internal/            # Internal server logic
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chat_server.py   # Main server class that handles requests
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database.py      # Class for managing the SQLite database
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ group.py         # Class for managing users in a group
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user.py          # Secondary class for handling individual messages in a thread
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.py              # Script to start the server
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ client/                  # Directory containing the client code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backup/              # Directory for storing client messages
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Client-000000.py # Example of how messages are stored
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ internal/            # Internal client logic
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chat_client.py   # Main client class
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ client.py        # Secondary class for managing messages and contacts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ util/                # Directory for utility functions
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ convert_posix.py # Functions to convert POSIX timestamps to standard dates
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.py              # Script to start the client
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ host.py                  # File that defines (or not) the HOST_IP
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Libraries and packages used
```

## Features

:heavy_check_mark: `Login`

:heavy_check_mark: `Register`

:heavy_check_mark: `Send individual message`

:heavy_check_mark: `Send group message`

:heavy_check_mark: `Show whether the message was delivered or read`

:heavy_check_mark: `Save messages from user who is offline (using SQLite)`

:heavy_check_mark: `Save client message history (using .json)`


## Usage
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `python server/main.py` in the base directory to start the server
- Run `python client/main.py` in the base directory (as many times you want) to open the clients that will consume the server
- Be happy testing on the client ðŸ¤
