# :newspaper: Project Description
<p align="justify ">
This work was carried out in the Computer Networks discipline and aimed to familiarize students with programming network applications using sockets, formalizing a protocol for this. 
In short, we needed to build an application similar to Whatsapp following the protocol specification created by professor Dr. Pedro de Botelho Marcos presented in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HDQIMFCnF1UYwMGFSK9v0luRymGnoUypVbuNAI-cCPQ/edit">link</a>.

# :hammer_and_wrench: To test the project
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `python server/main.py` in the base directory to start the server
- Run `python client/main.py` in the base directory (as many times you want) to open the clients that will consume the server
- Be happy testing on the client ðŸ¤
